# CSCI 570 Final Project: Sequence Alignment Problem 
In this project, we implemented the classical Sequence Alignment problem using python without any libraries or anything from scratch. In this project, we implemented two versions of the of basic alignment: 
## Basic Alignment using DP 
In this version, we implemented the basic alignment protocol without worrying about memeory efficiency 
## Memory Efficient Alignment using DP 
In this version, we refactored the basic alignment DP code to be memory efficient by only storing two rows of the DP matrix table at a time resulting in a drastic improvement in performance.
